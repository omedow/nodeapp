# nodeapp
this is the chat app i have created  it using node.js and socket.io  and express ,
it is not a production level so make sure to check the dependecies also you can edit source code and use them as you wish.
you will also  need socket.io front end library which i have included it on public folder
make sure to install all dependencies as they have been shown on package.json file

feel free to play around me code or email me
wackyizzy77@gmail.com if you are serious want to create something for production level and all of that stuffs
